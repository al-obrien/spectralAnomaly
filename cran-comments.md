## Resubmission

This is a resubmission for {spectralAnomaly}. This package is light-weight with 
the primary goal of implementing the spectral residual algorithm, which could be 
achieved compactly. The following changes were made:

* Removed spaces at end of lines in the description field of DESCRIPTION as it 
added too many spaces when including the return.

* Removed quotes and capitalization in the description field of DESCRIPTION 
for the phrase: spectral residual.

* Added reference and DOI for paper that inspired the package. 

* Added a check to function outputs to return a numeric vector instead of ts class
